In order to use the data, you need to download from the NAS my data set and organize it in the following way:

analysis_clean/
> data/
>>        /control
>>>            /ledX
>>>            /ledY
>>        /red
>>>            /ledX
>>>            /ledY
>>        /green
>>>            /ledX
>>>            /ledY
>>        /blue
>>>            /ledX
>>>            /ledY
>>        /uv
>>>            /ledX
>>>            /ledY
>    experimental_info/
>    main/
>    modules/

where X, Y in ledX, ledY refer to the number of LDSs usded in my experiments. You can download the folder from my NAS folder where I put the whole data analysis repo.
